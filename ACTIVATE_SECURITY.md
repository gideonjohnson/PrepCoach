---

## Step 3: Deploy to Production (2 minutes)

### 3.1 Trigger Deployment

# Trigger a new deployment to activate all security features
git commit --allow-empty -m "Activate security features"
git push origin master
```

### 3.2 Verify Deployment
1. Go to https://vercel.com/gideonbosiregj-6770/prepcoach
2. Wait for deployment to complete (~2 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

---

## Step 4: Test Security Features (2 minutes)

### 4.1 Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Test AI feedback rate limit (should allow 5 requests, block 6th)
# You'll need to be logged in to test this

# Open https://aiprep.work/practice in your browser
# Record and submit 6 responses quickly
# The 6th should show a rate limit error
```

### 4.2 Test Input Validation
```bash
# Test weak password validation
curl -X POST https://aiprep.work/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "weak"
  }'

# Expected response: Validation error about password requirements
```

### 4.3 Test Sentry Error Tracking
1. Go to https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR-ORG/issues/
2. You should see any errors from your app
3. Try triggering an error on your site to test

---

## Step 5: Configure Sentry Alerts (Optional, 2 minutes)

### 5.1 Set Up Error Alerts

   - If: `The issue is first seen`
   - Then: `Send a notification to` â†’ Your email
5. Click "Save Rule"

### 5.2 Set Up Performance Alerts
1. Create another alert
2. Choose "Performance"
3. Set conditions:
   - When: `A metric`
   - If: `transaction.duration` is `above` `1000ms`
   - Then: Send notification
4. Save

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

- [ ] Sentry DSN is set in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Sentry Auth Token is set in Vercel
- [ ] Upstash Redis URL is set in Vercel
- [ ] Upstash Redis Token is set in Vercel
- [ ] New deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Rate limiting works (test with multiple requests)
- [ ] Input validation works (test with invalid data)
- [ ] Errors appear in Sentry dashboard
- [ ] Sentry alerts are configured

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting Not Working
**Symptom**: Can make unlimited requests
**Solution**:
1. Check Upstash credentials are correct in Vercel
2. Verify Redis database is active in Upstash dashboard
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for Redis connection errors

### Sentry Not Receiving Errors
**Symptom**: No errors in Sentry dashboard
**Solution**:
1. Verify DSN is correct in Vercel env vars
2. Check Sentry project is active
3. Trigger a test error: Go to a non-existent page like `/test-404`
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for error to appear

### Input Validation Not Working
**Symptom**: Invalid inputs are accepted
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for validation errors
2. Verify Zod is installed: `npm list zod`
3. Check API route has validation code

### Environment Variables Not Applied
**Symptom**: Features not working after adding env vars
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you added vars to "production" environment
2. Trigger a new deployment: `git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy" && git push`
3. Wait for deployment to complete
