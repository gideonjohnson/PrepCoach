# Payment Gates - Fixed Implementation

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL PAYMENT LOOPS RESOLVED

---

## Problem Identified

The initial payment gate implementation was **blocking ALL free tier users** from accessing the main features, creating a poor new user experience where:

1. New users sign up (automatically assigned `free` tier)
2. Try to access `/practice` ‚Üí **Blocked with upgrade modal**
3. Try to access `/resume-builder` ‚Üí **Blocked with upgrade modal**
4. **Result:** Immediate paywall with no ability to try the product

This violated the intended free tier model where users get:
- **3 interviews per month**
- **5 AI feedback requests per month**

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Free Tier Definition to Pricing

**File:** `lib/pricing.ts`

```typescript
export const PRICING_TIERS = {
  free: {
    name: 'Free',
    price: 0,
    interval: 'month',
    features: [
      '3 interview sessions per month',
      '5 AI feedback requests per month',
      'Access to all 500+ roles',
      'Audio recording & transcription',
      'Basic analytics',
    ],
    limits: {
      interviewsPerMonth: 3,
      feedbackPerMonth: 5,
    }
  },
  // ... pro, enterprise, lifetime tiers
}
```

### 2. Removed Payment Gate from Interview Practice

**File:** `app/practice/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Blocked ALL free users immediately
if (data.tier === 'free') {
  setShowUpgradeModal(true);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Removed payment gate completely
// Free tier users now get 3 interviews/month
// Limits are enforced by /api/user/check-limits endpoint
```

The existing `/api/user/check-limits` endpoint already handles the monthly limits properly.

### 3. Kept Resume Builder as Pro-Only Feature

**File:** `app/resume-builder/page.tsx`

Resume Builder remains a premium feature, but now uses the proper API check:

```typescript
// Resume Builder requires Pro/Enterprise/Lifetime subscription
if (!data.hasAccess) {
  setShowUpgradeModal(true);
}
```
