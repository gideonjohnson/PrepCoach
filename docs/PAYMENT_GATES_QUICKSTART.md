## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint
```typescript
GET /api/user/subscription-status

Response:
{
  "tier": "free" | "pro" | "enterprise" | "lifetime",
  "status": "active" | "inactive" | "canceled",
  "hasAccess": boolean
}
```

### Access Control Logic
```typescript
// Free users blocked
hasAccess = user.subscriptionTier !== 'free'

// Tiers with access
✅ pro
✅ enterprise
✅ lifetime

// Tier blocked
❌ free
```

### Files Modified
1. `app/api/user/subscription-status/route.ts` (NEW)
2. `app/practice/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
3. `app/resume-builder/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: User sees modal but should have access
**Solution:** Check subscription tier in database
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-payment-gates.ts
```

### Issue: API returns 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** User needs to sign in
```typescript
// Redirect handled automatically
router.push('/auth/signin?callbackUrl=/practice')
```

### Issue: Modal won't close
**Solution:** This is by design! Users must:
- Upgrade to Pro/Enterprise/Lifetime, OR
- Click "Back to Dashboard"
