# Payment Gates Control

## Current Status: DISABLED ✅

Payment gates are currently **DISABLED** for your test group demo.

---

## How It Works

The payment gates can be toggled on/off using the environment variable:
- **Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_PAYMENT_GATES`
- **Value**: `true` (disabled) or `false` (enabled)

When disabled, ALL users get access to ALL features without needing a subscription.

## To Re-Enable Payment Gates (After Demo)

### Option 1: Via Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_PAYMENT_GATES production
# Then redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-enable payment gates"
git push origin master
```

### Option 2: Via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Select your **prepcoach** project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Find `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_PAYMENT_GATES`
5. Either:
   - Delete the variable completely, OR
   - Change value from `true` to `false`
6. Redeploy from the **Deployments** tab

## What's Affected When Disabled

When payment gates are disabled:
- ✅ Interview Practice - Full access
- ✅ LinkedIn Optimizer - Full access
- ✅ Career Roadmap - Full access
- ✅ Salary Negotiation Hub - Full access
- ✅ Resume Builder - Full access (already had its own check)

All users (free, pro, enterprise, lifetime) get the same full access.

## What's NOT Affected

The following still work normally:
- User authentication (login/signup)
- User profiles
- Database tracking
- Stripe integration (ready for when you add live keys)
- Admin privileges

---

## When to Re-Enable

Re-enable payment gates when:
1. You've shown your test group the demo
