# Payment Gates Control

## Current Status: DISABLED ✅

Payment gates are currently **DISABLED** for your test group demo.

---

## How It Works

Payment gates have been directly removed from all feature pages:
- **Interview Practice** (`app/practice/page.tsx`)
- **LinkedIn Optimizer** (`app/linkedin/page.tsx`)
- **Career Roadmap** (`app/roadmap/page.tsx`)
- **Salary Negotiation Hub** (`app/salary/page.tsx`)

All users now have **FREE ACCESS** to all features, regardless of subscription tier.

---

## To Re-Enable Payment Gates (After Demo)

When you're ready to add live Stripe keys and start monetizing:

### Step 1: Re-add PaymentGate Wrappers

Edit each page file to wrap the content with the PaymentGate component:

**app/linkedin/page.tsx** (line 829-831):
```typescript
export default function LinkedInOptimizerPage() {
  return (
    <PaymentGate feature="LinkedIn Optimizer">
      <LinkedInOptimizerContent />
    </PaymentGate>
  );
}
```

**app/roadmap/page.tsx** (line 870-872):
```typescript
export default function CareerRoadmapPage() {
  return (
    <PaymentGate feature="Career Roadmap">
      <CareerRoadmapContent />
    </PaymentGate>
  );
}
```

**app/salary/page.tsx** (line 702-704):
```typescript
export default function SalaryNegotiationPage() {
  return (
    <PaymentGate feature="Salary Negotiation">
      <SalaryNegotiationContent />
    </PaymentGate>
  );
}
```

**app/practice/page.tsx** (line 1275-1290):
```typescript
export default function PracticePage() {
  return (
    <PaymentGate feature="Interview Practice">
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <Suspense fallback={...}>
          <PracticeContent />
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </PaymentGate>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Commit and Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Re-enable payment gates for production"
git push origin master
```

## What's Affected When Disabled

Current free access:
- ✅ Interview Practice - Full access
- ✅ LinkedIn Optimizer - Full access
- ✅ Career Roadmap - Full access
- ✅ Salary Negotiation Hub - Full access
- ✅ Resume Builder - Full access (already had its own check)

All users (free, pro, enterprise, lifetime) get the same full access.

---

## What's NOT Affected

The following still work normally:
- User authentication (login/signup)
- User profiles
- Database tracking
- Stripe integration (ready for when you add live keys)
- Admin privileges
- Session history

---

## When to Re-Enable

Re-enable payment gates when:
1. You've shown your test group the demo
2. You're ready to add your live Stripe keys
3. You want to start monetizing
